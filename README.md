## Description

Big City Jobs is a website that provides users with a list of jobs in multiple locations. The website has signup and login functionality which allows users to save the jobs they are interested in with a favorite button. Users also have a profile page where they can view their favorite jobs. They can also get more information about the jobs on their profile page. This site would be useful for job seekers and employers, however our site does not use real world data at the moment.
